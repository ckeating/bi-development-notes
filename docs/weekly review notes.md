## Enabled — What Else Counts and Why It Matters

### What Enabled really means (one level deeper)

**Enabled work is anything you did that:**
- made future work easier, safer, faster, or higher quality  
- reduced risk, ambiguity, or rework  
- improved how other people (or future you) can operate  
- raised the baseline of how things get done  

Enabled is not about output.  
It’s about improving the *conditions* under which work happens.

## Major categories of Enabled work (with examples)

### 1. Applied Learning & Skill Development
**What it is:**  
Learning that changes how you build things going forward.

**Examples:**
- Learning correct fiscal date sorting and reusing it across models  
- Discovering how window functions depend on time boundaries and standardizing that approach  
- Refactoring logic from DAX into SQL for clarity and reuse  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
You prevented future errors and raised baseline quality.

---

### 2. Validation & Risk Reduction
**What it is:**  
Work that prevents incorrect, misleading, or premature outputs.

**Examples:**
- Validating Epic logic before dashboards go live  
- Identifying global Epic settings that skew metrics  
- Catching flawed assumptions before leadership sees a report  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
Value comes from what *didn’t* go wrong.

---

### 3. Clarifying Requirements & Reducing Ambiguity
**What it is:**  
Turning vague asks into buildable definitions.

**Examples:**
- Translating clinical language into precise inclusion criteria  
- Narrowing populations to feasible cohorts  
- Documenting agreed-upon logic  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
Clarity saves massive downstream effort.

---

### 4. Stakeholder Alignment & Expectation Management
**What it is:**  
Helping people agree on what’s being built and why.

**Examples:**
- Explaining feasibility constraints to clinical teams  
- Aligning leadership expectations around metrics  
- Preventing “this isn’t what we meant” rewrites  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
Aligned stakeholders enable smoother delivery.

---

### 5. Documentation & Knowledge Capture
**What it is:**  
Making knowledge reusable instead of tribal.

**Examples:**
- Documenting Epic quirks that affect reporting  
- Writing SOPs or metric definitions  
- Capturing Caboodle or Slicer Dicer gotchas  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
Documentation reduces dependency and rework.

---

### 6. Tooling, Automation, and Efficiency Gains
**What it is:**  
Lowering the cost of doing the work.

**Examples:**
- Using AI tools (Copilot) to accelerate analysis  
- Automating recurring extracts  
- Replacing manual Excel processes with semantic models  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
You increased throughput without increasing effort.

---

### 7. Architectural Decisions & Pattern Setting
**What it is:**  
Choices that shape how future solutions are built.

**Examples:**
- Deciding where logic should live (SQL vs semantic layer)  
- Establishing naming conventions or model structure  
- Creating reusable time intelligence patterns  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
You shaped the system, not just an artifact.

---

### 8. Mentorship & Informal Leadership
**What it is:**  
Helping others work better, even without formal authority.

**Examples:**
- Explaining modeling decisions to analysts  
- Helping debug complex issues  
- Sharing best practices  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
You multiplied impact beyond your own output.

---

### 9. Decision Support Without a Deliverable
**What it is:**  
Helping decide what *not* to build.

**Examples:**
- Showing a proposed report isn’t feasible  
- Demonstrating data quality limitations  
- Recommending scope changes or deferrals  

**Why it’s Enabled:**  
Avoiding bad work is real value.

## Weekly Enabled test questions

Ask yourself:
- Did this reduce future effort?
- Did this prevent a problem?
- Did this increase clarity or confidence?
- Did this raise the quality bar?
- Did this help others work better?

If yes to any → **Enabled**

## Important note

Enabled work often:
- closes no tickets  
- produces no visible artifact  
- happens in thinking, validation, or conversations  
- is easiest to forget under stress  

That doesn’t make it smaller.  
It makes it more senior.

## Anchor sentence

**Enabled is where professional judgment, experience, and leverage live.**
