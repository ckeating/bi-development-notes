## Enabled vs Learning — Clarifying Where This Work Belongs

**Short answer:**  
Yes — what you described absolutely lives under **Enabled**.  
And yes — learning *is* one aspect of Enabled, but only when it’s the right kind of learning.

## 1. Where do those semantic model learnings belong?

What you described is a textbook example of **Enabled** work.

Specifically, you:
- Refactored date logic down to the SQL layer, improving clarity, reuse, and correctness
- Learned and implemented proper fiscal date sorting (e.g., October → September)
- Understood how window logic depends on correct time boundaries, not just DAX patterns
- Translated SQL logic into reliable, reusable semantic model measures

This is not passive learning.  
It is **applied, durable learning that changes how future work gets done**.

That is Enabled.

## 2. Why this is Enabled (not Delivered or Advanced)

### Delivered?
No.
- No specific artifact was handed off *just* by learning this
- The value is the capability you built, not a single deliverable

### Advanced?
Sometimes learning supports Advanced work, but:
- Advanced is about moving a specific project forward
- What you learned here applies beyond one project

### Enabled?
Yes.
- It improves future work
- It reduces rework and errors
- It raises your baseline quality
- It shortens future delivery time
- It prevents subtle bugs (especially date-related issues)

That matches the definition of Enabled exactly.

## 3. Is learning just one aspect of Enabled?

Yes — **but only applied learning counts**.

### Not Enabled learning
- Reading docs without applying them
- Watching tutorials “for later”
- One-off tricks you never reuse

These do not belong in a work review.

### Enabled learning (what you did)
- Learning that changed architecture decisions
- Learning that simplified future builds
- Learning that standardized patterns
- Learning that prevented known failure modes

This belongs under Enabled.

## 4. How to capture this in a weekly review

Example entry:

**Enabled**
- Established reusable best practices for date handling in semantic models, including pushing fiscal logic to SQL, implementing correct fiscal sorting (Oct–Sep), and aligning window logic with proper time boundaries
- Improved reliability and reuse of date-based measures, reducing future refactoring and edge-case errors

This is not “I learned something.”  
This is “I raised the quality bar.”

---

## 5. How this shows up in a self-evaluation

That weekly entry rolls up to something like:

> This year, I strengthened foundational modeling practices by establishing reusable patterns for fiscal date handling, window logic, and SQL-to-semantic-layer design. These improvements increased consistency, reduced rework, and improved reliability across time-based reporting.

That is senior-level, accurate, and defensible.

## 6. One sentence to remember

**Learning is Enabled when it changes how future work gets done.**

If it does, capture it.  
If it doesn’t, don’t.
